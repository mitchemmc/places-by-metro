# Places By Metro

Places by Metro is an interactive map re-connecting travellers to businesses across Melbourne via public transport. It helps travellers discover bars, restaurants, and cafes within walking distance from train stations. It uses Googleâ€™s Javascript API Library to source the highest rated venues as well as provide specific details such as address, opening hours, and customer reviews and Google Maps to reference directions to each venue. 

Developed by City Science research group at Monash University: Mitchell McCaffrey, Andrew Ioannou, and Dr. Meead Saberi.
